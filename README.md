# RateStudySpace

Project Description:
Our project proposal is RateMyStudySpace. This app will allow users to rate and search for study spaces, based on a variety of metrics. They can rate and search based on quietness, space, affordability, etc. In addition, they can leave rating descriptions for other users to read. This app will be targeted towards students, remote workers, freelancers; anybody who needs a space to study/work. In the backend, we plan to store information about study spaces (libraries, cafes, other types of establishments), as well as information about reviews. As a stretch, we could also store information about user data. 



## Project task requirements:
### 3-5 minimal requirements (will definitely complete)
  * Setting up(Schema, connection from frontend) MangoDB for the database. (Done)
  * Landing page (done)
  * Post a review page (done, maybe just stylistic stuff)
  * Register a new study space page (done)
  * View/Filter study spaces page left to complete: hook up
### 3-7 "standard" requirements (will most likely complete)
  * Rest Endpoints(for registering new reviews, study spaces, and filtering) (done)
  * Queries(search, filter) for endpoints to execute in the database (done, just filter last changes)
  * Styling to make a modern user interface (needs more work)
  * Aggregation component for study space (average star rating, quietness, average of all reviews) (Work on next sprint)
  * Photo gallery of study space (done, reliability testing)
  * Thumbs up functionality for reviews. (work on in next sprint, maybe)
### 2-3 stretch requirements (plan to complete at least 1!)
  * Map view of study spaces, using pins (1)
  * Users will have their personal account (Profile setup) and recommendations. (2)
  * ML model to extract key info from reviews. (3)
